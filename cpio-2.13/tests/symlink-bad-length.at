# The exact error message and exit status depend on the host architecture,
# therefore strderr is filtered out and error code is not checked.

# So far the only case when cpio would exit with code 0 is when it skips
# several bytes and encounters a valid record header.  Perhaps it should
# exit with code 2 (non-critical error), if at least one byte was skipped,
# but that could hurt backward compatibility.
